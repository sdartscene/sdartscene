[Fern Street Circus](https://www.fernstreetcircus.com/) is a wholesome good time whether you're on a cute date or out with the whole family.

Set right off the University and the 15, this community group hosts regular shows and events teaching circus arts.

The Barker sets up dancers, clowns, stunts and all your classic vaudvillian acts.

I always look forward to seeing abuelitaladona@instagram perform!
