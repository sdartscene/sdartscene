![Flyer for Movement Open Mic](/img/movement-open-mic-at-lightbox.jpg)

Lightbox theater will be hosting a Movement Open Mic on Friday March 8th at 7PM!

This will be the first meeting of this group, and considering I heard about it after the weekly Contact Improv, I'd imagine the group that will be meeting up will be a treat of a mix of dance styles.

Slight tangent, but I recently became aware of the [Contact Improv Global Calendar](https://ciglobalcalendar.net/) if you are interested in other Contact Improv jams when you're out travelling!
