Remaining in Contact and Flow, I have heard that the Contact Improv jam will now have a new home at [the Light Box Theater at San Diego Dance Theater](https://www.sandiegodancetheater.org/lightboxtheater) in Liberty Station. Same time! Same great musicians! Hopefully much the same dancers!

* 5:30 Class
* 6:30-9 Jam
