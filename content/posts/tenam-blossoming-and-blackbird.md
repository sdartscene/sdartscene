Lexi Pulido has been performing at her space on Adams Avenue [Tenam Studio](https://www.tenamstudio.com/) for a few months now, giving a 15 minute performance EVERY DAY Monday through Friday at 10 AM.

The performances have included vocal work, movement, comedy, music, poetry and a rotating cast of guest artists supporting what I can only hope will become a San Diego institution.

I've been so lucky to see [Sean Francis Conway](https://seanfrancisconway.com/), [Katie Berns](https://katieberns.com/about), [Batya MacAdam-Somer](https://bmacadamsomer.wordpress.com/), [Nancy Elizabeth Ross](https://www.instagram.com/nancyelizaross/), [Lucy Ray](https://www.instagram.com/lucy.rayz/) and I'm sure others that I'm forgetting, but I'm only going to be able to get through writing this knowing that I'll write about this community again and again.

I'm a remote worker and I've found that I can swing by every now and again, get my fix of weird art, meet some excellent members of the community, then go about my coffee shop programming day.
It's been a brilliant addition to my life, and I hope you can find it's way into yours.

This week I was able to catch two performances, "In The Palm Of My Hand" by [Natasha Kozally](http://natashakozaily.com/) and "Blossoming" by the Owner of Tenam, [Lexi Pulido](https://www.lexipulido.com/).

Both performances displayed painful transformation and a sudden awareness of purpose.
"In the Palm of My Hand" had Natasha painstakingly felting a wool blackbird while the poem "[St. Kevin and the Blackbird](https://poetryarchive.org/poem/st-kevin-and-blackbird/)" was recited.

Afer the performance Natasha gave some insight into what drew her to the poem, that even a small sacrifice for another being can mean their whole world.
Maybe commitment can be freeing; exchanging a frenetic sense of choice with an actual purpose of being.

Instead of stabbing a being into life, Lexi organized a being into death in "Blossoming".
Yucca was slowly deconstructed into bouquets memorializing the plants' deathbed and finalized with Lexi's joyous pallor.
