Get your earplugs ready.

Noise, horror, angst, racial tension, inequality.

I definitely helped a guy get his shoulder back in after some mosh pit mishap.

Be kind to yourselves, but Stay Strange.

[Stay Strange](https://staystrange.com) throw some infrequent yet excellent events featuring noise, thrash and experimental artists of San Diego.

I've seen some of the most imaginative art through this collective, including:
  - [Nakatani Gong Orchestra](https://www.tatsuyanakatani.com/ngo)
  - [No Know (sound band)](https://www.noknowsoundband.com/)
  - [Ketcel](https://staystrange.com/ketcel-chad-deal/)

Most of their shows have a pretty big selection of local artists selling prints, zines, toys and books that are worth having.
All DIY stuff that isn't what you would find at your average festival or farmer's market.
