![Invitation to RobYko at Crenshaw Dairy Mart](/img/RobYko-at-Crenshaw-Dairy-Mart.jpg)

RobYko will be having a performance and gallery presentation of their multimodal work at the [Crenshaw Dairy Mart](https://www.crenshawdairymart.com/).

Saturday March 2, 2024 4PM - 5PM

I met the pair who goes by RobYko while attending a show at [Tenam](https://www.tenamstudio.com/).

They are enamoured with performance art to the point that every interaction with them feels a bit like a grad school seminar.

They often apologize for it, but I eat it up.
And this tracks, they both have Professed The Arts.

They always send me home with the best kind of homework.
Be it watching [Yoko Ono's "Cut Piece"](https://vimeo.com/106706806).
Falling into a wikipedia rabbit hole with [0 to 9 Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_to_9_Magazine).
Or digging into their minor linguistic project Alchemicode.

They have their own font!
Their artwork is often coupled with research documents!
Meticulous Chaos.

I mean, they refer to their home as the Infinity House.
I love their integration of performance art, political discourse and mathematical imagery.
They have a very interesting message woven in and out of the abstract.
